# TODO

Single source of truth for deferred work across this project. Each entry links back to the spec, plan, or file that introduced it. Removed when done.

## Assets

- **Poly Haven model fetcher** — Poly Haven serves models as multi-file gltf+bin+textures bundles, not single GLBs. Need a pipeline path that downloads the .gltf + .bin + referenced textures, then repacks via gltf-transform's `NodeIO` into a self-contained .glb. v1 furniture manifest ships empty until this lands. See [asset-population plan Task 14](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-asset-population.md).
- **Kenney bundle extraction** — Kenney's furniture kit ships as a single archive, not per-file GLBs. Add an extract-from-zip step (or host per-file mirrors) before adding Kenney entries to the manifest. See [asset-population plan Task 14](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-asset-population.md).
- **KTX2 texture compression** — `@gltf-transform/functions`'s `textureCompress` lacks a bundled KTX2 encoder; current pipeline ships JPG/PNG at 2K. To get the KTX2 size/VRAM benefit promised in the spec, integrate `@gltf-transform/cli` (which ships `toktx`) or a standalone `basisu` binary. See [scripts/asset-pipeline/process-texture.ts](scripts/asset-pipeline/process-texture.ts).
- **Drop-folder material auto-detection** — current indexer skips material folders without a sidecar. A future improvement could infer channels from filenames (`*_diff.*`, `*_nor.*`, etc.) like the Poly Haven naming convention. See [scripts/asset-pipeline/index-assets.ts](scripts/asset-pipeline/index-assets.ts).
- **Standard asset set (~80 assets, ~120 MB)** — manifest schema already supports it; expand when v1 Starter set is in production. See [asset-population spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-asset-population-design.md#v1-contents-starter-25-assets-30-mb-target).
- **Per-LOD texture variants** — for performance on lower-end devices. See [asset-population spec — Out of scope](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-asset-population-design.md#out-of-scope-for-this-spec).
- **Lazy-loading / streaming individual GLBs** — current approach bundles refs at build; revisit if total bundle size becomes a problem. See [asset-population spec — Out of scope](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-asset-population-design.md#out-of-scope-for-this-spec).
- **Quaternius pack inclusion** — manifest source enum already admits `quaternius`; add concrete entries when expanding past Starter.
- **`builtinCatalog.ts` solid-swatch entries for floor textures** — once the texture pipeline is exercised end-to-end, the eight solid-swatch entries (`floor-wood-oak`, `floor-wood-walnut`, etc.) can be deleted; the generated catalog will provide textured equivalents under the same ids. See [src/materials/builtinCatalog.ts](src/materials/builtinCatalog.ts).

## Risks tracked from specs

- **Asset source URL drift** (Poly Haven / ambientCG slug versioning) — pin to stable per-asset URLs in manifest, audit periodically. See [asset-population spec — Risks](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-asset-population-design.md#risks).
- **Bbox-derived footprints can be wrong** for off-floor anchors / non-uniform scale — documented in drop-folder README; revisit if it bites users. See [asset-population spec — Risks](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-asset-population-design.md#risks).

## Process

- Update this file every time a plan is designed or work is implemented (see `MEMORY.md` feedback rule).

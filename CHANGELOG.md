# Changelog

Autonomous improvement log for the HDB 3D interior-design sandbox. Newest first.
Each entry corresponds to one focused commit on
`claude/codebase-analysis-optimization-QKCK6`. See `TASKS.md` for the backlog.

## [Q2] "Recent" catalog row for fast re-placement

A staple of every mainstream interior-design app (Planner5D, Coohom, IKEA
Kreativ) — quick access to the items you just used. Added:

- `state/slices/recentSlice.ts` — an ordered, deduped, capped (24) list of
  recently-placed catalog ids, persisted to `localStorage` (`hdb_recent_items`),
  kept out of the save schema/autosave (per-device convenience).
- Hooked from `itemsSlice.addItem`, the single path real user placements,
  duplicates and pastes flow through — the boot seed + set drops use `setItems`,
  so the list stays meaningfully "recently used".
- A **clock "Recent" chip** in `CategoryTabs` (shown only when non-empty, right
  after favourites) and a resolved `recent` list on `useUnifiedCatalog`
  (local-def-only, newest first, orphans dropped). Empty-state copy added.
- Unit-tested; visually verified in the running app (placing an armchair + side
  table surfaces them newest-first under the Recent chip).

## [R2] Surface auto-save failures (localStorage quota)

Auto-save errors were caught but silently swallowed — a user whose browser
storage filled up could keep editing and lose everything on reload with no
warning. Now:

- `startAutosave` gained an `onRecover` hook (fires when a write succeeds after a
  prior failure) alongside the existing `onError`.
- `bootstrap.ts` wires both to a single deduped error notification ("Couldn't
  auto-save", with a quota-specific message) that auto-clears once saving resumes.
- Confirmed the appearance/quality/editor/user-style pref writers already guard
  their `setItem` calls, so no silent throw escapes a store subscriber.
- New `autosave.test.ts` covers the error → recover flow.

## [R1] React error boundary — no more white-screen crashes

A render/lifecycle throw anywhere in the React tree previously blanked the whole
app. Added a modular `src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`:

- **Top-level boundary** (in `main.tsx`) wraps the entire app with a themed
  recovery card (Try again / Reload / Reset layout & reload), collapsible
  technical details, and console diagnostics (no remote telemetry).
- **Scene-scoped boundary** wraps `<Scene>`/`<RoomEditorScene>` so a 3D/WebGL
  render crash keeps the toolbar and panels usable instead of taking the page down.
- The "Reset layout & reload" escape-hatch clears only the boot-restored
  `sofa-so-good:save:autosave` slot (named saves + appearance/onboarding prefs
  are preserved), so a corrupt autosave can't crash-loop the app.
- Supports a custom `fallback` renderer for embedding in other surfaces.
- Unit-tested (`ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`): renders children, catches throws,
  shows scope + details, custom fallback, reset callback.

# Changelog

Autonomous improvement log for the HDB 3D interior-design sandbox. Newest first.
Each entry corresponds to one focused commit. The pre-C251 history (C1–C250) was
pruned from `main`; entries from C251 on (branch
`claude/codebase-analysis-optimization-ny3xm9`) are kept here. See `TASKS.md` for the backlog.

## [C261 / P-720 tail] 360° tour follow-ups: IDB image cache, room-centre yaw, plan stop placement, share-link embedding
Four P-720 follow-ups shipped in one focused commit. **(1) IDB image cache**: new pure
`ui/panorama/panoImageIdb.ts` (`sofa-pano-cache` database, separate from the asset store to
avoid version-bump conflicts) stores captured panorama Blobs keyed `<stopId>:<designKey>` where
`designKey` is a djb2 hash of `{items, finishes, floorPlan, doors, userFurniture}` — revisiting
a stop skips the expensive re-render unless the room or furnishings changed; stale entries are
evicted on access; LRU cap of 30 entries; `evictPanoStop` called on stop removal / drag-end to
force a fresh capture from the new position. `PanoTourModal` now tries the IDB cache before
capturing live; Re-capture evicts then recaptures. **(2) Per-stop room-centre yaw**: new pure
`stopInitialYaw(stop, rooms)` in `panoTour.ts` uses the shape-aware `roomLabelPoint` centroid
(matching the plan-editor labels) and `yawToward` to compute the viewer yaw that faces the room
centre on arrival; the tour modal uses it for direct stop selections (hotspot jumps still face
the travel direction). **(3) Plan-based stop placement**: `FloorPlanEditor` now renders numbered
tour stop markers (ringed dot + number) on the 2D plan SVG when the `panoTour` flag is on; stops
are draggable in the select tool via a new `movingStop` state that mirrors the existing
`movingItem`/`movingVertex` pattern — drag-end evicts the IDB cache for the moved stop; upper-
storey stops render greyed and non-draggable (ground-level only for simplicity). **(4) Share-link
embedding**: `panoTourStops` added as an optional additive field in `schema.ts`
(`RawSerializedStateZ` + `serialize` + `applySerialized`) — old links without the field decode
to `[]` (backward-compatible); the design-share and plan-share codecs carry stops automatically
since both call `serialize`; images are NOT embedded (receivers capture live). +19 new unit tests:
`computeDesignKey` mutation coverage, IDB miss/hit/evict/clear, `stopInitialYaw` round-trip
(including outside-room and at-centre fallbacks), share-link round-trip with/without stops, old-
link compat, `applySerialized` restoration. Verified headless: tour-stop markers visible on the
2D plan as numbered circles with the stop labels offset; opening the tour with a stop places the
viewer facing the room centre; mobile 390×844 plan + tour modal both render correctly.
## [C262 / Q31 tail] Drop-target highlight + custom-plan overview wall-drop cue
Two polish items deferred from C251. (1) **Transient drop-target highlight**: while
a finish swatch is dragged over the 3D canvas a visible ring/tint overlay appears,
implemented as a pure DOM `<div>` (`FinishDragOverlay`) absolutely positioned over
the canvas, styled with `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 3px var(--accent)` +
`background: var(--accent-soft)` — no hardcoded colours, works in light + dark +
all 5 themes. The overlay renders nothing when inactive, so frameloop-demand
frames are unaffected (zero GPU cost at rest). State is managed by a new
`finishDragSignal.ts` module-level singleton (`setFinishDragActive` /
`subscribeFinishDrag`) wired to `useSyncExternalStore` in the overlay component —
deliberately outside the Zustand store to avoid triggering `RenderPump`'s
`subscribe(markDirty)` on every dragover tick. `FinishDropSurface` drives the
signal: `dragenter` → active, `dragleave`/`drop` → inactive; a `window dragend`
listener also clears it (catches the "drag released outside the browser window"
case where the canvas never fires `dragleave`). (2) **Custom-plan overview wall
drop cue**: `PlanShell`'s `FadeWall` meshes carry no `finishTarget` userData (they
are unassociated boxes at the overview level), so drops on them previously silently
no-oped. New `hasUntaggedHits()` helper in `finishDropTarget.ts` distinguishes an
empty-sky miss (zero hits) from geometry-hit-but-unclassifiable (the overview-wall
case). When a drop lands on untagged geometry in the custom-plan overview (not in
the room editor), a 3 s info toast guides the user: "Open a room to finish its
walls". +18 tests (signal state machine: enter/over/leave/drop/dragend/cancel all
clear; idempotency; subscribe/unsubscribe; hasUntaggedHits: tagged/untagged/invisible
hits, ancestor-walk). `tsc` + full suite green.
## [C260 / LP6] Lux overlay — time-of-day scrub, auto-play, and per-fixture exclusion
Extends the static 3D lux floor heatmap (C256/LP5) with live time-of-day scrubbing and
per-fixture contribution isolation. `LuxOverlay.tsx` now reads `luxExcludedIds` from the
store and filters out excluded fixtures before recomputing grids; the memo already reacts
to `manualHour` via `useSunPosition` / `lightingFromAltitude`, so scrubbing the time-of-day
slider in either the Scene menu or the new inline slider updates the heatmap live (debounced
implicitly by the quantised fixture/daylight levels — sub-percent changes don't churn the memo).
A `luxPlaying` rAF loop auto-advances `manualHour` at 1 hr/s for a full-day preview. New
store state (`luxExcludedIds: string[]`, `luxPlaying: boolean`) + actions in `featuresSlice.ts`
— clearing on overlay-off; per-fixture toggle (`toggleLuxExcluded`), bulk set, play toggle.
`ElevationPanel.tsx` gains two new sections in the Lighting tab: (1) a compact time slider (reusing
`setManualHour` / `effectiveHour`) with a ▶/⏹ play button showing the current clock; (2) a
scrollable per-fixture checkbox list labelled "Fixture contributions — uncheck to isolate" with
struck-through dimmed text for excluded items — responsive on both desktop and mobile
bottom-sheet. Gated behind the same pro-tier `drawings` flag. 16 new unit tests: store slice
actions, per-fixture exclusion changes lux computation, time-input sensitivity, flag/mode gating.
Verified headless: 09:00 (warm orange/red pools, high fixture contribution), 13:00 (similar but
with higher daylight component), 20:00 night (deep blue/teal pools, no daylight), and with
3 fixtures excluded (reduced pool area); no z-fighting, no loading-screen artifacts on any shot.
Mobile panel (390 px) shows fixture list and slider cleanly. `drawings` flag off in Simple,
on in Pro.
## [C259 / PERF9] Per-pattern procedural texture size registry — GPU memory reduction
Added `PATTERN_SIZE_CAP` registry in `procedural/generators.ts` that declares the maximum useful
resolution for each of the 17 procedural patterns, and `effectivePatternSize(pattern)` which clamps
the global `BASE_SIZE` (256 on Performance, 512 on Medium+) to that cap. Smooth/noise-based patterns
(`carpet`, `concrete`, `marble`, `terrazzo`, `batten`, `fluted`, `plaster`) cap at 256² regardless
of tier — saving 75 % of their GPU texture memory on Medium/High/Maximum with no visible quality
difference at typical room-viewing distances. High-frequency geometric patterns (`wood`, `tile`,
`hexagon`, `checker`, `parquet`, `herringbone`, `subway`, `brick`, `grasscloth`, `stripe`) cap at
512² so their grain lines, grout, and mortar joints stay sharp on Medium+ tiers but still drop to
256 on Performance. Cache keys in `cache.ts` now use `effectivePatternSize` so tier changes correctly
invalidate only the patterns that actually resized; `getBuiltMaterial` probes both `@512` and `@256`
suffixes for backward-compatible furniture `mat:<id>` lookups. 5 new unit tests verify the registry
and clamping logic across both tiers. OffscreenCanvas worker generation remains deferred (PERF9 tail).
Visually verified at Performance/256 tier: smooth textures (plaster, carpet, concrete) look identical
to 512²; high-frequency textures (wood grain, tile grout) correctly receive 256 on Performance where
quality tradeoff is acceptable. `QualityController` already set `BASE_SIZE` per tier (unchanged).

## [C258 / PF2] Parametric furniture v2 — drawers, per-compartment config, desk type
Extends the PF1 generator with three new capabilities. (1) **Drawers**: a new
`CompartmentStyle = 'open' | 'door' | 'drawer'` drives `addDrawerFronts()` which emits stacked
`drawer-front` + `drawer-handle` parts at ~0.18 m per drawer, inset within the bay opening —
drawer handles are brushed metal via the furnitureMaterials cache. `price.ts` adds a DRAWER_ADDER
per front (drawer box + slides + handle). (2) **Per-compartment configuration**: each bay of a
wardrobe or sideboard can independently be set to open / door / drawer; `bayStyle(spec, b)` resolves
from the per-bay `compartments[]` override then falls back to the global `doors` toggle. A compact
`BayStylePicker` segmented control (Open / Door / Drawer per bay) appears in the dialog below the
Doors toggle for wardrobe and sideboard types. Changing the global toggle clears per-bay overrides
for a clean reset. (3) **Desk**: new `desk` type with real-metre HDB-sized limits (60–200 cm wide,
68–82 cm tall, 50–85 cm deep); two leg options — four-leg (square corner legs, floor-anchored) and
pedestal (right-side carcass with stacked drawers + two left legs). Desk saves to the `tables`
category. `saveParametric.ts` maps each type to its catalog category via `TYPE_CATEGORY`. 54 unit
tests across spec/buildParts/price/dialog — all passing; `tsc` and `biome` clean. Headless visual
verification: bookshelf 3D preview shows floor-anchored shelves; desk preview shows four-leg worktop
with correct proportions (120 × 75 cm default); mobile layout stacks preview above controls with
full-width dialog. No floating parts, z-fighting, or clipping observed.

## [C257 / PF1] Parametric furniture — dimension-driven shelving/wardrobe/sideboard generator
First milestone of the procedural-furniture subsystem (IKEA PAX/BILLY · Tylko configurator
parity). New pure `furniture/parametric/` module: a typed spec `{type, w, h, d, options}` is
clamped to sensible per-type min/max and emitted as a structurally-sound part list — sides reach
the floor, shelves span between sides with auto-spacing, a centre divider is auto-added past
~1.2 m so shelves never span unsupported, back panel inset, wardrobe doors split into ≤0.6 m
leaves, sideboard legs-vs-plinth — all built from real three materials (tintable wood +
`mat:<id>`). A responsive `ParametricDialog` offers type tabs (bookshelf / wardrobe / sideboard),
dimension sliders + option toggles, a live R3F preview, a material-volume price estimate, and an
"Add to room" action; each generate saves a NEW user catalog def (identical specs de-dupe by
content hash), so placement/collision/budget treat it like any other item and it survives
save/reload (additive schema field carries the def-level price). New `parametricFurniture` flag
(tier pro, default on, prod-safe pure code), gated in the catalog drawer, ⌘K (`COMMAND_FLAGS`),
and the mobile toolbar; both-modes tests. Verified headless: the bookshelf preview shows
evenly-spaced shelves with sides on the floor and the wardrobe splits into two handled doors —
both structurally clean, no floating parts or z-fighting. Deferred: drawers, per-compartment
config, more types.

## [C256 / LP5] 3D lux-coverage heatmap overlay on the floor
The lighting plan's illuminance can now be read in the actual scene, not just as 2D numbers.
New pure `lighting2d/luxGrid.ts` (per-room sample grids from fixtures + daylight) +
`luxColor.ts` (a perceptual blue→green→yellow→red ramp with residential lux breakpoints) feed
`scene/LuxOverlay.tsx`, which renders one translucent `DataTexture` plane per visible level's
rooms 5 mm above the floor (`depthWrite` off, transparent — no z-fighting) at the storey's
elevation. Toggled from the Drawings panel's Lighting tab (`luxOverlayOn`) with a colour→lux
legend, and gated by the same pro-tier `drawings` flag as the rest of the lighting plan
(LP1–LP4). Recompute rides the existing render-time memos on items/plan/level/daylight —
nothing per-frame; textures dispose on toggle-off. Edge cases handled: rooms with no samples
never emit NaN, polygon rooms supported. Verified headless at midday: per-room heatmaps hug the
floor with a smooth gradient that varies sensibly by room (brighter near windows), no shimmer.
+both-modes flag test. Deferred follow-up only.

## [C255 / GE3c] GLB designer per-part texture pick
Parts in the GLB designer can now take a real material/texture, not just a solid colour. The
part spec gains an optional `finish` (`mat:<id>`); `partMaterial` resolves it through the
existing furniture-material cache and returns a CLONE of the shared textured material (textures
stay shared, per-part glow/opacity still apply on top, roughness/metalness sliders hide because
the finish's own maps win). CSG-combined results get box-projected metre-scale UVs
(`boxProjectUvs`) so a tiling finish reads at the right physical scale instead of smearing one
texel. The ~900-line dialog's part inspector is extracted into a new `PartInspector.tsx` reusing
the inspector's finish dropdown + `QuickFinishes` swatch row (Oak/Walnut/Teak/Ash/Ebony/Marble).
The finish persists through the save-asset round trip (re-resolved at render, like solid colours).
Rides the existing GLB-designer flag — no new flag. Verified headless: clicking "Oak" sets the
part finish to `mat:floor-wood-oak` and the box renders with tiling wood grain (not flat/black),
no artifacts. Deferred: per-part texture on combined-mesh parts takes the first part's material.

## [C252 / P-720] Linked 720° panorama tour — multi-pano capture with room hotspots
Coohom "720° tour" parity. A tour is an ordered list of stops `{id, label, position:[x,z],
levelId?}` in the new `panoTourSlice`, persisted per-device to localStorage like saved camera
views (images are NOT stored — each stop is captured live + session-cached when viewed, so the
tour always reflects the current design, same model as the C237 presentation slides). Hotspots
are derived, never authored: pure `ui/panorama/panoTour.ts` computes yaw (`atan2(−dx,−dz)`,
matching the viewer's −Z-forward convention) + pitch toward every other stop, culling
coincident (guards the degenerate atan2), distant (>14 m) and cross-storey stops, with
room-derived labels + duplicate numbering and screen projection for the overlay pills. Capture
reuses the C217 pipeline with one additive extension — `capturePanorama({eye})` honours an
explicit eye at the stop position + level elevation. The viewer overlays clickable/tappable
hotspot pills (fade → fresh capture → arrive) plus a numbered stop strip; `PanoramaViewer`
gained generic optional `initialLook`/`onLook` props (stays chrome/store-free). New `panoTour`
flag (tier pro, default on, consistent with `panorama` — asserted by a test), gated in the File
menu (desktop AND mobile), two ⌘K commands, and an "Add to tour" button in the panorama modal.
+31 tests (pure math, slice, both-modes flag). Verified headless with real SwiftShader
captures: kitchen stop shows a geometrically-correct "Living / Dining" hotspot dead ahead,
clicking it lands in the living-room pano; mobile 390×844 modal clamps + strip scrolls.
Deferred: share-link/presentation embedding, plan-based stop placement UI, IDB image
persistence, per-stop initial yaw.

## [C251 / Q31 part 2] Drag finish swatches onto the 3D canvas — raycast drop
Dragging a swatch from the finish picker and releasing it over the 3D view now applies the
finish to whatever is under the cursor — room floor, wall, or furniture item — completing the
Q31 drag-to-apply program (part 1 shipped the pure payload/`resolveFinishDrop` core + Layers-row
drops). New pure classifier `scene/finishDropTarget.ts` walks the raycast hit list, skipping
invisible hits (the camera-facing wall reveal toggles `visible`, which three's Raycaster does
NOT skip) and untagged meshes (grid/gizmos/sky), and classifies via `userData` tags
(`itemId` on `Furniture` roots; `finishTarget {kind, roomId}` on floor meshes, wall interior
faces, and room-editor shells). `scene/FinishDropSurface.tsx` does the thin DOM wiring in BOTH
Canvases (main + room editor): native `dragover`/`drop` on the GL canvas (R3F's pointer system
never sees HTML5 drag events), `dropEffect='copy'` feedback, manual `Raycaster.setFromCamera`,
and it only claims events carrying the finish MIME — catalog-card placement and upload drops
untouched. Commits flow through the new shared `state/finishDropApply.ts` (now also used by the
Layers rows): exactly one undo step per drop, floor/wall recents, success toast — and it fixes a
latent part-1 bug by normalising raw catalog ids to `mat:<id>` on item drops (previously fell
back to generic wood). Part 1 had shipped ungated, so this adds the `finishDnd` flag
(`tier: 'simple'`, default on) gating picker dragstart + both drop surfaces. Touch keeps the
existing tap-to-apply flow (HTML5 DnD doesn't exist there). +18 tests (classifier, apply path,
both-modes flag). Visually verified headless: floor → checker, wall → navy, table → ebony in
one session with `past` 1→4, foreign-payload and sky drops no-ops; docs updated. Deferred:
custom-plan overview wall drops no-op (overview walls are unassociated fade boxes); transient
target highlight skipped under frameloop=demand.

## [C254 / PERF-FOLLOWUPS] History cap amortisation + frame-scoped overlap memo
Two backlog micro-optimisations. `historySlice.appendCapped` no longer slice-and-spreads the
whole past stack on every push once the 50-entry cap is hit: the stack grows into a 16-entry
headroom band and is trimmed back to the cap with ONE amortised slice, so steady-state pushes
stay a single spread copy; undo depth is always ≥ the cap and undo/redo/jump semantics are
unchanged (new tests pin the trim point, dropped-oldest order, and a full undo drain across a
trim). `collision/findItemOverlaps` gains a frame-scoped single-slot memo: same-task calls with
unchanged `items`/`defs` identities (several panels can scan in one render pass) return the
cached array allocation-free; it invalidates on identity change and self-expires on microtask
flush because OBBs read the mutable GLB-footprint cache. +6 tests; behaviour-preserving (full
suite green).

## [C253 / X-SHOP tail] SG retailer expansion in the dev price sidecar — Courts/HipVan/Castlery
The dev-only live-pricing sidecar (`scripts/price-server.mjs`) now has three retailer adapters
alongside IKEA SG: Courts (Magento GraphQL search), HipVan (Algolia-style hits), Castlery
(JSON-LD products in the search page HTML), each following the existing convention — pure
exported parser + URL builder, candidates re-ranked by fuzzy name match
(`scoreNameMatch`/`pickBestMatch` with the retailer's own top hit as fallback), all upstream
fetches timeboxed at 8 s, shape drift degrading to a 404 `no match` and network errors to a 502
`{error, retailer}` (never a crash). `/price` responses carry `retailerLabel`. Client:
`livePrice.ts` adopts the retailer list from `/health` (never hardcoded), fetches all retailers
per item in parallel with per-retailer failures dropping out, and returns offers
**cheapest-first**; the Budget panel prices each line/total by the cheapest offer and renders a
wrappable cheapest-first row of retailer buy links. Gating unchanged: the same devOnly pro-tier
`livePrices` flag, with a new test asserting it stays off in prod (Simple AND Pro). Verified
desktop 1600×1000 + mobile 390×844 with a stubbed sidecar: offers render cheapest-first, a 404
retailer drops silently, 4-offer rows wrap cleanly. The retailer URL/response shapes are
best-effort offline reconstructions — a real-network verification pass is tracked in TODO.md.
+15 tests.

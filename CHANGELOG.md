## [R1] React error boundary — no more white-screen crashes

A render/lifecycle throw anywhere in the React tree previously blanked the whole
app. Added a modular `src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`:

- **Top-level boundary** (in `main.tsx`) wraps the entire app with a themed
  recovery card (Try again / Reload / Reset layout & reload), collapsible
  technical details, and console diagnostics (no remote telemetry).
- **Scene-scoped boundary** wraps `<Scene>`/`<RoomEditorScene>` so a 3D/WebGL
  render crash keeps the toolbar and panels usable instead of taking the page down.
- The "Reset layout & reload" escape-hatch clears only the boot-restored
  `sofa-so-good:save:autosave` slot (named saves + appearance/onboarding prefs
  are preserved), so a corrupt autosave can't crash-loop the app.
- Supports a custom `fallback` renderer for embedding in other surfaces.
- Unit-tested (`ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`): renders children, catches throws,
  shows scope + details, custom fallback, reset callback.
